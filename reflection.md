# Reflection

Once I understood how the classes were supposed to interact the assignment made a lot more sense especially with separating the responsibilities like the Computer handling its own data and the ResaleShop managing the inventory helped me better code their specific methods that handles that.

When working on the resale shop I wondered why inventory was initilized as an empty list but now I understand that when we create a new shop, it should always start empty since no computers haven't been bought yet.

An advice I would give to future students is to think about which class should be responsible for each action. A good question to ask is: “Does this behavior belong to the object itself or to something that manages the object?” This helped me understand where each method should go. I would also suggest testing the code often while working because it’s much easier to fix small mistakes early instead of waiting until the end.
